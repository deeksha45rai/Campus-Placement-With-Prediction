# Campus-Placement-System

Placements can provide a student with a variety of advantages and opportunities. When the majority of the job is done manually, an educational institution’s training and placement management are key components. The manual systems used by colleges take a lot of time and effort. In order to solve this issue, we want to build a web platform with this project. The project’s goal is to create an application for the college’s placement office. With the right login enabled, the system is an application that can be utilized efficiently across the entire enterprise. It can also be utilized as a tool for the college’s placement officers to handle student placement information, which will cut down on human labor and paper use. The system also offers the capability of viewing the student’s academic and personal data. The system receives the requested list of candidates for businesses looking to hire persons who meet their eligibility requirements.Campus Placement System to perform Campus Recruitment activities through a portal for students to get campus drive details and to register for the same.
